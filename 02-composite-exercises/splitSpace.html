            Welcome to Split Space. <br> where we believe that sgaring the cost of housing should be simple, transparent, and beneficial for everyone involved. Our nission is to create a platform that brings indivisuals together to collaboratively share
            the expenses of comfortable living spaces, fostering a sense of community and financial ease.

        <h1 class="htext"><u>Our</u> Vision</h1>
        <p>At split Space, we envision a future where the burden of housing costs is lightened through shared responsibility. We aim to create a network of like-minded individuals who recognise the value of cooperative living and the positive impact it can
            have both their wallets and overall well-being.
